        <h2>Software Developer</h2>
        <p>"Hello, my name is Pablo. More than a year ago I immersed myself in the universe of programming, taking courses and projects on PLATZI, an online learning portal, where I obtained multiple certifications. My knowledge covers a variety of languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as JavaScript , HTML, CSS, React.js, Git, GitHub, Linux, Docker, etc. At the same time, I have perfected my English level.

In my quest to gain hands-on experience in IT, I joined HENRY (Programming Bootcamp). This experience allowed me to work full-time in a real environment, cooperating with colleagues as a team through Pair Programming and using collaboration tools such as Slack, Discord, Zoom, Meet, Notion, etc.

I also had the opportunity to work as a Regional Manager. This role helped me strengthen my leadership skills, managing to work effectively with varied teams and manage highly complex projects.

Currently, I am looking to be part of a company where I can continue developing and growing. My goal is to be able to contribute and gain more experience."</p>

        <p>Hello! I am Pablo, and a couple of years ago I immersed myself in the universe of Programming, carrying out courses and projects on PLATZI, an online learning portal, where I obtained multiple certifications, including "Full Stack Developer" and other related ones. My knowledge covers a range of languages such as: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, Git, GitHub, Linux, Docker, etc. At the same time, I have perfected my level of English.</P>

<P>In my quest to gain practical experience in IT, I joined the HENRY Bootcamp. This experience allowed me to work full-time in an environment that replicates the real world, cooperating with colleagues as a team through Pair Programming, remotely and using collaboration tools such as: Slack, Discord, Zoom, Meet, Notion, etc.
Beyond my technical skills, I had the chance to work as Regional Manager at Personal Telecom (Meditel). This role has given me the opportunity to strengthen my leadership capabilities. I have learned to work effectively with varied teams and manage highly complex projects.</P>
<P>Currently, I am looking for a job as a Programmer where I can continue developing and growing. My goal is to contribute to a company and gain more experience.</p>
